# Curated set of transitions

In the CSV file [mcc_transitions_table_Validated.csv](https://github.com/nestauk/mapping-career-causeways/raw/main/supplementary_online_data/transitions/transitions_tables/mcc_transitions_table_Validated.csv) please find a set of transitions recommended by our career transitions algorithm and validated using the crowdsourced feasibility ratings.

All transitions in this table are *viable*, meaning that they are above the minimal combined similarity threshold (`similarity` > 0.3) and they have a compatible level of education and experience as measured by the job zone variable (`job_zone` difference is no larger than 1). They are also *desirable* in that they have `annual_earnings` of at least 75% of the origin destination's level, and *safe* because the destination occupations `risk_category` is not 'High risk' (see the [research report](https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/Mapping_Career_Causeways_01_G2XA7Sl.pdf) for more discussion on these filtering parameters).

Moreover, these transitions have also been judged as feasible, either by the participants in our [crowdsourcing study](https://github.com/nestauk/mapping-career-causeways/tree/main/codebase/reports/crowd_feasibility_ratings/) (`is_feasible` = True), or by the predictive model that we built for estimating the public perception ratings for transitions not covered by the crowdsourcing study (`is_feasible_predicted` = True).

Note that the feasibility rating predicted by the model `is_feasible_predicted` might disagree with the real rating `is_feasible` from the crowdsourcing study. Therefore, we use both and assume that the crowdsourced feasibility, if exists, overrules the predicted one.

More generally (not in this table), the predicted crowd feasibility ratings in `is_feasible_predicted` might disagree with the algorithm predictions about viability or desirability. In many cases, the feasibility appears somewhat more conservative than the algorithm recommendations. Therefore, when generating recommendations using the `transition_utils.py` module, you might wish to use the feasibility ratings carefully not to exclude some perhaps more broader or adventurous recommendations. An option for broadening the career options would be to inspect both feasibility and viability side by side, or to slightly relax the threshold for feasible transitions.
