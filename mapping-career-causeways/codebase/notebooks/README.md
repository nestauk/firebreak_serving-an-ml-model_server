# Data analysis notebooks

Here you will find Jupyter notebooks with the analyses that underpin the Mapping Career Causeways [research report](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/mapping-career-causeways-supporting-workers-risk/) and the [crowdsourcing study](https://github.com/nestauk/mapping-career-causeways/tree/main/codebase/reports/crowd_feasibility_ratings/). The notebooks are organised in the following sections:

- **00_preprocessing**: Preparation of ESCO and ISCO data for further analysis
- **01_automation_risk**: Analysis of automation risk for ESCO occupations
- **02_demographic_analyses**: Analysis of demographic patterns of at-risk workers
- **03_link_occupational_data**: Linking ESCO occupations to various external labour market data
- **04_occupation_comparisons**: Calculations of occupation similarity
- **05_transition_analyses**: Analysis of career transitions for at-risk workers
- **06_visualisation**: Code of creating a 2-D 'map' of occupations and visualising similarity matrices
- **07_validation**: Analysis of the crowdsourcing study data

To get started, see the two tutorial notebooks in this folder.
