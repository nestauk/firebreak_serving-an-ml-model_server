**`transitions_utils.py`**  
Module for generating and analysing career transition recommendations; for examples of usage, see `Tutorial_01` [notebook](https://github.com/nestauk/mapping-career-causeways/tree/main/codebase/notebooks/).

**`load_data_utils.py`**  
Module for easy access to project data; for examples of usage, see `Tutorial_02` [notebook](https://github.com/nestauk/mapping-career-causeways/tree/main/codebase/notebooks/).

**`compare_nodes_utils.py`**   
Module for calculating NLP-adjusted overlap of skillsets (underpins the functionality of `transitions_utils`). For an overview of the underlying methodology, see pp. 87-89 of the Mapping Career Causeways [report](https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/Mapping_Career_Causeways_01_G2XA7Sl.pdf).
